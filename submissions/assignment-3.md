## Tokenized Crowdfunding Smart Contract

### Overview
The Tokenized Crowdfunding smart contract is a Solidity-based system designed to facilitate decentralized fundraising. Contributors receive ERC20 reward tokens based on their contributions, while top funders are recognized with ERC721 NFTs. The contract ensures fair tracking of contributions, secure fund withdrawals, and automated reward distribution.

### Features

ERC20 Reward System: Contributors receive CrowdToken (CRT) based on their funding amount.
NFT Recognition: High-value contributors exceeding a threshold receive a CrowdNFT.
Contribution Tracking: Stores funders' contributions to ensure transparent allocation.
Secure Fund Withdrawal: The project owner can withdraw funds only if the funding goal is met.
Deployment on Testnet: Designed for Sepolia testnet deployment and interaction.
